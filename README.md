## Quick start
1. Clone the repo
  - git clone <repo-url>
2. Open the project
  - cd /c:/Users/Saksham.Gupta/Desktop/Development/react-projects/todo-list
3. Install dependencies
  - npm install
  - (or) yarn
  - (or) pnpm install
4. Start the dev server
  - npm start
  - (or) npm run dev
  - Note: run the script that matches the project (check package.json)

## Available scripts (common)
Run `cat package.json` (or open it) and use the scripts listed there. Common examples:
- npm start — start dev server (Create React App)
- npm run dev — start dev server (Vite)
- npm run build — build for production
- npm run preview — preview the production build

## Project structure (example)
- src/
  - components/ — UI components (TodoItem, TodoList, Header, Filters)
  - hooks/ — custom hooks
  - utils/ — helpers
  - styles/ — global styles / themes
  - App.jsx / index.jsx
- public/ — static assets

Adjust to match your repository.

## Contributing
- Create a branch per feature/fix: git checkout -b feat/my-feature
- Follow commit and PR conventions
- Run tests and linter before opening a PR

## Notes / To-do for README upkeep
- Replace generic commands with actual scripts from package.json
- List exact feature set by scanning src/
  - e.g., check for localStorage usage, API clients, drag-and-drop libs, theming files
- Add screenshots, deployment link, environment variables, and demo instructions

## License
Add your license (e.g., MIT) or remove if not applicable.

If you want, I can open the repository and auto-generate a precise README based on package.json and src code — allow access or paste package.json and the src tree.
